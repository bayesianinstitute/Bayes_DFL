def winner_creates_mqtt_broker():
    """
    This function represents the action taken when the winner of the DFL process creates an MQTT broker.

    Algorithm:
    1. Check if the current node is the winner.
    2. If the current node is the winner, create an MQTT broker to facilitate communication.
    3. Return a message indicating that the MQTT broker has been created.

    Returns:
    A message confirming the creation of an MQTT broker by the winner node.
    """

def send_communication_link_to_others():
    """
    This function represents the action taken when the winner sends a communication link to other participants.

    Algorithm:
    1. Check if the current node is the winner.
    2. If the current node is the winner, generate a communication link.
    3. Send the communication link to other participants in the DFL process.
    4. Return a message confirming the successful transmission of the communication link.

    Returns:
    A message confirming that the communication link has been sent to other participants.

def receive_mqtt_broker_link():
    """
    This function represents the action taken when a participant receives the MQTT broker link from the winner.

    Algorithm:
    1. Wait for the winner to send the MQTT broker link.
    2. Receive the MQTT broker link.
    3. Return a message indicating that the MQTT broker link has been received.

    Returns:
    A message confirming the reception of the MQTT broker link.

def start_dfl_using_mqtt():
    """
    This function represents the action taken to start distributed federated learning (DFL) using MQTT communication.

    Algorithm:
    1. Initialize the DFL process.
    2. Configure DFL to use MQTT for communication.
    3. Start the DFL process using MQTT as the communication method.

    Returns:
    A message indicating that DFL has started using MQTT for communication.

def winner_becomes_aggregator():
    """
    This function represents the action taken when the winner node becomes the aggregator in the DFL process.

    Algorithm:
    1. Check if the current node is the winner.
    2. If the current node is the winner, assume the role of the aggregator.
    3. Return a message confirming that the winner node has become the aggregator.

    Returns:
    A message indicating that the winner node has assumed the role of the aggregator.
