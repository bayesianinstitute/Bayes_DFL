### Introduction
Time Series Forecasting is a critical task in various domains, including finance, weather prediction, and many others. This project showcases how to use TensorFlow and Keras to create an LSTM model for forecasting stock prices based on historical data.

### Requirements
Before using this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* scikit-learn (for data preprocessing)
* yfinance (for downloading stock price data)
* Matplotlib (for data visualization)
You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn yfinance matplotlib
```

### Usage
To use this Time Series LSTM forecasting model, follow these steps:

* Clone or download this repository.

* Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

* Open a Python environment or IDE of your choice.

Run the TimeSeriesLSTM class with the desired configuration. You can specify the stock ticker symbol, start and end dates, sequence length, and the number of LSTM units.

```

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Specify the stock ticker symbol, start and end dates, sequence length, and number of LSTM units
    ticker = "AAPL"  # Replace with the desired stock symbol
    start_date = "2022-01-01"
    end_date = "2023-01-01"
    sequence_length = 10
    num_units = 64

    # Create a TimeSeriesLSTM object with a custom log directory
    lstm_forecast = TimeSeriesLSTM(ticker, start_date, end_date, sequence_length, num_units, optimizer='adam', log_dir='custom_LSTM_logs')

    # Train the LSTM model
    lstm_forecast.train_lstm_model(epochs=100, batch_size=32)

    # Evaluate the model
    test_loss = lstm_forecast.evaluate_lstm_model()
    print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}')

    # Make forecasts
    input_data = lstm_forecast.x_test  # Use the test data for forecasting
    forecasts = lstm_forecast.forecast_lstm(input_data)
    print("Forecasts:", forecasts)
```
The model will be trained on the specified stock price data, and you can evaluate its performance and make forecasts.
Customization
You can customize the project in several ways:

* Modify the LSTM architecture in the build_lstm_model method in the TimeSeriesLSTM class.
* Adjust training parameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, and optimizer in the train_lstm_model method.
* Change the data preprocessing steps in the load_and_preprocess_data method.
* Customize the log directory and TensorBoard settings in the run_tensorboard method.
