## Introduction
Time Series Forecasting is a crucial task in various fields, including finance, weather prediction, and many others. This project demonstrates how to use TensorFlow and Keras to build a simple RNN model for forecasting stock prices based on historical data.

## Requirements
Before using this project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* scikit-learn (for data preprocessing)
* yfinance (for downloading stock price data)
* Matplotlib (for data visualization)
* You can install these libraries using pip:
* bash
```
pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn yfinance matplotlib
```
## Usage
To use this Time Series RNN forecasting model, follow these steps:

* Clone or download this repository.

* Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

* Open a Python environment or IDE of your choice.

Run the TimeSeriesRNN class with the desired configuration. You can specify the stock ticker symbol, start and end dates, sequence length, and the number of RNN units.

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Specify the stock ticker symbol, start and end dates, sequence length, and number of units
    ticker = "AAPL"  # Replace with the desired stock symbol
    start_date = "2022-01-01"
    end_date = "2023-01-01"
    sequence_length = 10
    num_units = 64

    # Create a TimeSeriesRNN object with a custom log directory
    rnn_forecast = TimeSeriesRNN(ticker, start_date, end_date, sequence_length, num_units, optimizer='adam', log_dir='custom_RNN_logs')

    # Train the RNN model
    rnn_forecast.train_model(epochs=100, batch_size=32)

    # Evaluate the model
    mse, mape = rnn_forecast.evaluate_model()
    print(f'Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse:.4f}')
    print(f'Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): {mape:.4f}%')

    # Make forecasts
    input_data = rnn_forecast.data  # Use the historical stock price data for forecasting
    forecast = rnn_forecast.forecast(input_data)
    print("Forecast:", forecast)

```
The model will be trained on the specified stock price data, and you can evaluate its performance and make forecasts.
Customization
You can customize the project in several ways:

Modify the RNN architecture in the build_rnn_model method in the TimeSeriesRNN class.
Adjust training parameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, and optimizer in the train_model method.
Change the data preprocessing steps in the load_and_preprocess_data method.
Customize the log directory and TensorBoard settings in the run_tensorboard method.
