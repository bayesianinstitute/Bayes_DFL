## MQTT Cluster Code
This is a Python code that implements an MQTT cluster using the Paho MQTT library. The code allows you to create a cluster of MQTT clients, each of which can communicate with each other using MQTT messaging. Below, you'll find an overview of the code and how to use it.

## Overview
The code defines a MQTTCluster class, which represents an MQTT cluster with multiple clients. Each client in the cluster can communicate with other clients using both global and internal messaging.

## Getting Started
Import the required libraries:

paho.mqtt.client for MQTT communication.
random, time, json, and logging for miscellaneous operations.
Create an instance of the MQTTCluster class with the following parameters:

* broker_address: The address of the MQTT broker to connect to.
* num_clients: The number of clients in the cluster.
* cluster_name: The name of the cluster.
* global_cluster_topic: The global topic for cluster-wide communication.
* internal_cluster_topic: The internal topic for communication within the cluster.
* head_status: A boolean indicating whether the client is the head (leader) of the cluster.
* id: An identifier for the client.
* Call the create_clients() method to initialize and connect the MQTT client to the broker.

* Subscribe to the internal cluster topic using subscribe_to_internal_messages() if you want to receive internal messages within the cluster.

* Implement custom logic for handling incoming messages by overriding the on_message method.

* Use the provided methods to send messages within and between clusters.

### Class Methods
* create_clients(): Initializes the MQTT client and connects to the broker.
* on_message(client, userdata, message): Handles incoming messages.
* is_worker_head(client): Checks if the client is the head of the cluster.
* subscribe_to_internal_messages(): Subscribes to the internal cluster topic for message reception.
* receive_internal_messages(): Registers the on_message method to receive internal messages.
* stop_receiving_messages(): Unsubscribes from the internal cluster topic.
* send_model_hash(): Sends model hashes within the cluster and waits for all hashes to be available.
* global_model(): Retrieves the global model from the cluster.
* send_internal_messages_model(modelhash): Sends internal messages with a model hash.
* send_inter_cluster_message(message): Sends a message to the global cluster topic for inter-cluster communication.
* send_internal_messages(): Sends internal messages within the cluster.
* send_internal_messages_global_model(modelhash): Sends the global model as an internal message.
* switch_broker(new_broker_address): Switches the MQTT broker for the cluster and reconnects the clients.

## Example Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use this code:


```
# Instantiate an MQTT cluster
cluster = MQTTCluster("mqtt.broker.com", 5, "MyCluster", "global_topic", "internal_topic", True, 1)

# Create and connect MQTT clients
cluster.create_clients()

# Subscribe to internal messages
cluster.subscribe_to_internal_messages()

# Implement custom logic for handling messages
# Override the on_message method

# Send and receive messages within the cluster

# Disconnect clients when done
cluster.client.disconnect()
```
