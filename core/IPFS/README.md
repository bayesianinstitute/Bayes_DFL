# IPFS Communication with TensorFlow Models
This Python code provides a simple way to interact with IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for pushing, fetching, and downloading TensorFlow models. It includes an IPFS class that encapsulates the necessary functionality.

Prerequisites
Before using this code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

IPFS: The IPFS daemon should be running on your local machine.
Installation
To use the IPFS and TensorFlow functionalities in this code, install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install ipfshttpclient tensorflow
IPFS Communication Class
The IPFS class provides methods to push, fetch, and download TensorFlow models using IPFS:

fetch_model(model_hash)
Fetch a model from IPFS using its hash.
Returns the loaded TensorFlow model.
push_model(saved_model_path)
Push a TensorFlow model file to IPFS.
Returns the IPFS hash of the pushed model.
download_model(model_hash, destination_folder)
Download a model from IPFS using its hash and save it to a specified destination folder.
Returns the loaded TensorFlow model.
Usage
Here's an example of how to use the IPFS class to push, fetch, and download a TensorFlow model:

python
```Copy code
import os
import ipfshttpclient
import io
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import tempfile

# Initialize the IPFS communicator
ipfs_communicator = IPFS()

# Define the destination folder to save the downloaded model
destination_folder = 'downloaded_models'

# Ensure the 'downloaded_models' directory exists
os.makedirs(destination_folder, exist_ok=True)

# Push the trained model to IPFS and get the hash
model_hash = ipfs_communicator.push_model('saved_model.h5')

# Access the model hash
print("Model Hash:", model_hash)

# Download the model and save it to the destination folder
downloaded_model = ipfs_communicator.download_model(model_hash, destination_folder)
print("Model downloaded:", downloaded_model)
```
In this example:

We initialize the IPFS communicator by creating an instance of the IPFS class.
Define the destination folder to save the downloaded model (destination_folder).
Push a pre-trained TensorFlow model (assumed to be saved as 'saved_model.h5') to IPFS, and obtain the model's IPFS hash.
Download the model from IPFS using its hash and save it to the 'downloaded_models' directory.
The downloaded model is then loaded into TensorFlow and can be used for further tasks.
Ensure you have a TensorFlow model file (saved_model.h5) available in your working directory before running the code.

This code makes it easy to leverage IPFS for TensorFlow model storage and retrieval, enabling decentralized and efficient model sharing
