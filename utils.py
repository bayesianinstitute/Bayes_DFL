def is_model_better():
    """
    This function checks if the current model is better than the previous one.

    Algorithm:
    1. Compare the performance metrics of the current model with the previous model.
    2. Determine if the current model is better based on defined criteria.
    3. Return a message indicating whether the current model is better.

    Returns:
    A message indicating whether the current model is better than the previous one.
